# MERN

MERN is a free and open-source JavaScript software stack for building dynamic web applications. The stack comprises four key technologies: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. MERN is designed to make the development process smoother and easier, allowing developers to easily build full-stack JavaScript applications. MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that allows for easy storage and retrieval of large amounts of data. Express is a flexible and lightweight web application framework for Node.js that provides robust features for web and mobile applications. React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to build scalable and high-performance applications. These technologies provide a powerful and flexible platform for building modern web applications.
